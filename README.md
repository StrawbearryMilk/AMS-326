# AMS-326 - Numerical Analysis
This course focuses on numerical techniques such as finding roots, integrating and differentiating functions, solving differential equations, regression and interpolation, matrix techniques, and optimization. This repository contains my homework and exam codes, as well as reports used to define the problem and show the results.

Python was used for most of the course, with some Java programs due to it being much faster than Python.
